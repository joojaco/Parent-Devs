# Parent Devs Discord Server Rules

Welcome to the Parent Devs Discord server! This server is for parents (and parents-to-be) who are active coders that also balance the job of full-time parenting.

## Discrimination

Discrimination of ANY kind is not tolerated here. This is a welcoming community - any verified reports of racism, sexism, religious descrimination, etc., will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate ban.

## NSFW

This is a wholesome community, and NSFW content of any kind will result in a ban.

## Disagreements

We are all individuals; we may have differing opinions in various topics. As stated previously, discrimination should be reported immediately to moderators. However, other than that, member conflicts should try to be resolved first between the parties. If conflicts cannot be resolved, report them to moderators for additional review/action.

## Logging

We log all messages in this server, including original messages/comments that have later been edited.

## Manners

This is a safe space to share our struggles, accomplishments, and everything else in between. We are here to lift each other up, provide support, and celebrate achievements. As such, if you can't say something nicely, don't say anything at all. Trolling will result in an immediate ban, and patronization will result in appropriate action.
